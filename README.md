# 🛡️ Insurance Product Recommendation Agent

This project demonstrates a Generative AI-powered interactive chat agent designed to recommend suitable insurance products to users based on their specific needs and information. Built for BFSI (Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance) sector, it showcases the power of LLMs (Large Language Models) in customer engagement and personalized recommendations.

The agent engages the user in a conversational flow, gathering essential details such as age, dependents, income, assets, health, travel habits, and budget. Based on this collected information, it leverages a Generative AI model to analyze the user's profile against a predefined product catalog and offer tailored insurance recommendations with explanations.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface**: User-friendly conversational flow built with Streamlit.
- **Sequential Questioning**: Guides the user through a series of questions to gather relevant information.
- **AI-Powered Interpretation & Recommendation**: Uses a Generative AI model to understand user input and generate personalized insurance product suggestions.
- **Configurable LLM Backend**: Supports Google Gemini API ( gemini-2.0-flash model )
- **Modular Codebase**: Organized into separate files for UI, LLM service, and product data.

## 🚀 Technology Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web UI.
- **Google Generative AI (Gemini API)**: The primary Generative AI model for robust and scalable recommendations.  
  *(Alternative: Ollama with Mistral for local inference if configured)*
- **python-dotenv**: For managing environment variables (e.g., API keys, model names).
- **requests**: For making HTTP calls to the Gemini API.

🛡️ Insurance Product Recommendation AgentThis project demonstrates a Generative AI-powered interactive chat agent designed to recommend suitable insurance products to users based on their specific needs and information. Built as a solution for a 5-hour virtual hackathon in the BFSI (Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance) sector, it showcases the power of LLMs (Large Language Models) in customer engagement and personalized recommendations.The agent engages the user in a conversational flow, gathering essential details such as age, dependents, income, assets, health, travel habits, and budget. Based on this collected information, it leverages a Generative AI model (configurable for Google Gemini API or local Ollama with Mistral) to analyze the user's profile against a predefined product catalog and offer tailored insurance recommendations with explanations.✨ FeaturesInteractive Chat Interface: User-friendly conversational flow built with Streamlit.Sequential Questioning: Guides the user through a series of questions to gather relevant information.AI-Powered Interpretation & Recommendation: Uses a Generative AI model to understand user input and generate personalized insurance product suggestions.Configurable LLM Backend: Supports Google Gemini API (recommended for cloud deployment/no local setup) or local Ollama with Mistral (for local development/offline use).Dynamic UI: Enhanced Streamlit UI with custom styling, emojis, and a progress indicator for a better user experience.Modular Codebase: Organized into separate files for UI, LLM service, and product data.🚀 Technology StackPython: Core programming language.Streamlit: For building the interactive web UI.Google Generative AI (Gemini API): The primary Generative AI model for robust and scalable recommendations.(Alternative: Ollama with Mistral for local inference if configured)python-dotenv: For managing environment variables (e.g., API keys, model names).requests: For making HTTP calls to the Gemini API.📁 Project Structureinsurance_agent/

🛠️ Setup GuideFollow these steps to get the Insurance Product Recommendation Agent running on your local machine.PrerequisitesGoogle Gemini API Key: Obtain your API key from Google AI Studio.Step-by-Step InstallationClone the Repository:git clone <repository_url> # Replace <repository_url> with the actual URL
cd insurance_agent

Install Python Dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt

Configure Environment Variables:Create a file named .env in the root of the insurance_agent directory and add the following content:MODEL_NAME="gemini-2.0-flash"
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GENERATED_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"

Important: Replace "YOUR_GENERATED_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE" with the actual Google Gemini API Key you obtained in the prerequisites step.Note on MODEL_NAME: You can technically change "gemini-2.0-flash" to other Gemini models if you have access (e.g., gemini-pro), but gemini-2.0-flash is generally fast and cost-effective for these types of conversational tasks.Running the ApplicationOnce all the setup steps are complete, you can run the Streamlit application:Ensure your virtual environment is activated.Run the Streamlit app:streamlit run app/main.py

Access the Application:Streamlit will typically open a new tab in your default web browser (or provide a URL) where your application is running. It will usually be something like http://localhost:8501.🤝 UsageOnce the application loads, the AI advisor will greet you and ask the first question.Type your answers in the input box at the bottom of the chat interface.The agent will guide you through a series of questions to gather your insurance needs.After all questions are answered, the agent will process your information and provide personalized insurance product recommendations.You can click the "🔄 Start New Recommendation" button to restart the conversation at any time.📄 LicenseThis project is open-source and available under the MIT License.
